			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>My name is Kristofers Gobins, I enjoy different foods, esspecially asian, I like to workout in the gym, and most importantly, acting. I dont differ much from any other person, many would see that as a negative, but I say that means im more relatable. Im not all boring though, I would say others see me as creative, communicative and friendly. Its not hard for me to find new friends and adapt to new environments, which I would say gives me an advantage on the field, as i take little time to adapt, and move on to the work rather quickly. I have some experience in acting which you can check out on my <a class="intext" href="Projects.html" type="button">projects page</a>. Because I have experience in both spheres of acting (theatre, movies), I would say I have a good grasp of whats going on and how it happens. Im ready to build my experience and meet new people in the scene.</p>
